# SE322---SUMAY
# Goals:
This project purpose is to help us represent and model architecture using Architecture Analysis & Design Language and the OSATE environment.
# Description: 
 This project consist of three phases. We will learn  OSATE environment and AADL structures in the first part. In the second step, the architecture is built, using OSATE and AADL structures to produce views that are necessary to present primary decisions. Finally, we will improve the architecture in phase three of this project by fixing any faulty views generated and adding new views as appropriate.
